# The well-synchronization check (§4.2, Figure 4)

`CheckWellSynchronized` is the executable algorithm of Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`) of the
Weft paper: given a CTA `T` and *one* concrete complete trace `τ` that runs
`(I, T)` to `done` (Figure 4's `assume τ ≡ (I, T), …, (F, done)`), it returns a
`Bool` that is `true` iff `T` is well-synchronized (Definition 6), together with the
computed happens-before relation (the transitive closure of Figure 4 line 17).

The idea (paper §4.2) is to read the generation map `Gen(τ)` off the *single*
concrete trace, build a static happens-before relation `R` that *every* schedule
must respect, take its transitive closure, and then check that `R` already forces
each later-generation barrier operation to wait for the matching earlier-generation
`sync`. If it does, no alternative schedule could pair the synchronizations up
differently, so all traces share `Gen(τ)` and `T` is well-synchronized.

This is the *checking* side of the development; the `*.WellSynchronized` predicates
of `Weft.WellSynchronized` are the *specification* (Definitions 6–7). We implement
the algorithm faithfully but do not yet prove the paper's soundness/completeness
(Definitions 9–10) linking the two.

## Computable `Gen(τ)` (`pointGen`)

`Gen(τ)` is Definition 5's relation `IsGenOf` turned into a function on program
points. Its two ingredients, time and recycle-counting, are already computable:
`recycleCount` counts recyclings directly from the trace, and the time `t(τ, η)` is
found by `pointTime`. We locate the executing step of `η = ⟨i, k⟩` by program
*length*: thread `i`'s remaining program shrinks only by dropping prefixes (it is
always a suffix of `T.prog i`, by `CTAStep.progOf_suffix`), so a suffix is pinned
down by its length. Instruction `k` executes at the step where thread `i`'s
remaining length falls from `|T.prog i| − k` to `|T.prog i| − k − 1` — for a `sync`
this is the recycle step, exactly as in Definition 3. This matches `IsTimeOf` /
`IsGenOf` on a genuine trace from `(I, T)` (the 1-indexed `+ 1` convention, with `0`
for a command that never executes — see the `IsGenOf` doc).

Every `Relation.TransGen` pair lands in the executable `transClosure`. The argument is
the diameter bound: a `TransGen` pair has a *shortest* `R`-chain, whose vertices are
distinct (a repeat could be cut, contradicting minimality), so its edges are distinct
elements of `R` — at most `R.card` of them — and a `k`-edge chain is reached after
`k - 1 ≤ R.card` saturation rounds. -/

/-- **Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`).** Returns `(ok, hb)` where `ok = true` iff the CTA `T`
is well-synchronized (Definition 6), and `hb` is the computed happens-before
relation — the transitive closure (Figure 4 line 17) of the static edges built from
`Gen(τ)`. (The relation is returned regardless of `ok`, e.g. for downstream
race-freedom analysis, Definition 8.)

`τ` is a concrete complete trace from `(I, T)` ending in `done` (the algorithm's
standing assumption — e.g. from `CTA.WellSynchronized.exists_successfulTrace`, or a
concrete simulation; a `τ` that deadlocks or errors already witnesses a violation
and need not be checked).

A direct transcription of Figure 4. Step 3 (lines 18–22) checks: for every `sync`
`c1` of generation `k` on barrier `b`, and every barrier-`b` operation `c2` of
generation `k+1` whose in-thread predecessor is `c3`, `hb` must already order `c1`
before `c3` (`(c1, c3) ∈ hb`). If some such ordering is missing, a different
schedule could pair the synchronizations up differently, so `ok = false`. -/

/-- The happens-before relation of Figure 4, as a *relation* on program points (the
object Definition 4 / Lemma 1 talk about), rather than as the executable `Finset`
returned by `CheckWellSynchronized`. It is the **reflexive**-transitive closure of
the static edge set `initRelation T τ`, via the canonical `Relation.ReflTransGen`.

Reflexivity is not cosmetic: Definition 4 (`SoundAndPrecise`) uses `≤`, so at
`η₁ = η₂` the timing side is unconditionally true (`IsTimeOf.unique`) and a
sound-and-precise relation *must* relate every point to itself. The executable
`(CheckWellSynchronized T τ).2 = transClosure (initRelation T τ)` is the irreflexive
`Relation.TransGen` part (a finite set, so it cannot carry the diagonal of the
infinite `ProgPoint`); `happensBefore` adds the diagonal back. The two agree off the
diagonal — see `happensBefore_iff_mem`. -/

/-! ## Lemma 1 — the happens-before relation is sound and precise (Definition 4)

Weft's **Lemma 1**: *for well-synchronized configurations the static happens-before
relation as constructed in Figure 4 is sound and precise* (Definition 4,
`Weft.SoundAndPrecise`). That relation is the second component returned by the
algorithm, `(CheckWellSynchronized T τ).2`. Definition 4 is an *iff* between an edge
of `R` and a schedule-independent timing fact; its two directions are the soundness
and preciseness sublemmas below, which assemble into the full lemma. `happensBefore_sound`
is *proved* below by reducing (via `mem_transClosure_imp_transGen` and `Relation.TransGen`
induction) to two per-edge facts, `initRelation_edge_sound` and `initRelation_src_timed`,
which carry the remaining semantic content as stubs; `happensBefore_precise` is still a
full stub. -/

/-- The computable `pointGen` *is* the generation: for a barrier command `a` that
executes in `τ`, `IsGenOf (I, T) τ a (pointGen T τ a)` holds (`pointTime` computes the

/-- Soundness half of Lemma 1: every pair `(η₁, η₂)` of the happens-before relation
`happensBefore T τ` is a *genuine* ordering — in every complete trace from `(I, T)`,
`η₁` executes no later than `η₂`. (Per the paper: direct, because there is no
out-of-order execution within a thread and well-synchronization fixes barrier
generations across all traces.) This is the `→` direction of `SoundAndPrecise`.

Proved by induction on the reflexive-transitive chain: the reflexive base is the
trivial `η₁ = η₂` case (equal times, `IsTimeOf.unique`); each appended edge is sound
(`initRelation_edge_sound`), and the intermediate node executes
(`initRelation_src_timed`), so `≤` chains.

/-- **Realizability / reversing-schedule lemma** — the heart of preciseness (the
genuine cross-thread content). If `η₁` is *not* happens-before `η₂`, then some
complete trace from `(I, T)` runs `η₂` strictly before `η₁`.

Construction (strategy C/D, by induction on program size `CTA.numCmds`): the set
`G = {η | ¬ happensBefore T τ η₁ η}` is *down-closed* under `initRelation` edges — it
is a per-thread program **prefix** (program order), and it contains whole barrier
rounds (same-generation `sync`s are mutually related, so a round is wholly in or
wholly out of `G`). Run `G` to completion first — reaching a clean configuration with
exactly the complement `F` remaining — then finish with `exists_completeTrace`. Since
`η₂ ∈ G` (`¬ happensBefore η₁ η₂`, reflexively `η₂ ≠ η₁`) and `η₁ ∉ G` (`happensBefore`
is reflexive), `η₂` executes in the `G`-prefix and `η₁` in the `F`-suffix, so
`t(η₂) < t(η₁)`.

The contrapositive wrapper (`happensBefore_precise`,
different-threads case) is complete. -/

/-- Preciseness half of Lemma 1: the happens-before relation captures *every* genuine
ordering — if `η₁` executes no later than `η₂` in every complete trace from `(I, T)`,
then `happensBefore T τ η₁ η₂` holds. (Per the paper: by induction on program size,
since the tuples in `R` are the only ordering restrictions the semantics imposes.)
This is the `←` direction of `SoundAndPrecise`.

The `η₁, η₂ ∈ T.progPoints` hypotheses are **necessary**: a non-executing point has no
`IsTimeOf`, so `hle` would hold vacuously while `happensBefore` (whose edges only touch
program points, `initRelation_cases`) cannot relate it — the same vacuous-timing defect
that forced reflexivity, now for invalid indices.

Cases on the two points:
* `η₁ = η₂` — `Relation.ReflTransGen.refl`.
* same thread, `η₁ ≠ η₂` — `hle` forces `η₁.idx < η₂.idx` (`time_lt_of_idx_lt`), and the
  program-order edges chain `η₁` to `η₂` (`progOrder_happensBefore`). **Proved.**
* different threads — the genuine content: an inter-thread ordering must run through a
  barrier, and one must exhibit the `Relation.TransGen` chain witnessing it (the paper's
  argument that the `initRelation` tuples are the *only* restrictions the semantics
  imposes).

happens-before relation constructed in Figure 4 — `happensBefore T τ`, the
reflexive-transitive closure of `initRelation T τ` — is sound and precise in the
sense of Definition 4 (`Weft.SoundAndPrecise`), **on program points**.

The valid-point restriction (`η₁ η₂ ∈ T.progPoints`) is required: the unrestricted
`SoundAndPrecise` is false, because for a never-executing point the timing side is
vacuously true while `happensBefore` cannot relate it (see `happensBefore_precise`).

there by induction, *not* via Lemma 1).

Proof (`not_wellSynchronized_of_check_false`, §5.2.7). Assume `T.WellSynchronized` and
`check = false`; derive `False`. `exists_failing_pair` extracts a flagged pair — a
generation-`k` `sync` `c1` on `b` and a generation-`k+1` barrier op `c2` on `b` with
in-thread predecessor `c3` — with `(c1, c3) ∉ (CheckWellSynchronized T τ).2`. The `sync`
self-loop forces `c1 ≠ c3`, so the `transClosure` converse (`mem_transClosure_of_transGen`,
the now-proved Pillar A) gives `¬ happensBefore T τ c1 c3`. Then, by the command of `c2`:

  * `c2` an **arrive** — the only edge into an `arrive` is program order from `c3`
    (`happensBefore_arrive`), so `¬ happensBefore c1 c2`; the realizability lemma runs
    `c2` before `c1`, where it would observe generation `≤ k ≠ k+1` — contradiction
    (`reverse_barrier_contradiction`).
  * `c2` a **sync** — split on `happensBefore c1 c2`. If `¬ happensBefore c1 c2`, `c2`
    runs before `c1` exactly as above. Otherwise `c2` is forced after `c1`, and the
    *operational* competing-sync reversal (`competing_sync_false`) runs the ideal `G`
    to a configuration where `c1` and `c2` both head their threads poised to `sync b`,
    then fires `c2` into `c1`'s round (generation `≤ k`, or `err`) — again contradicting
    schedule-independence of generations.

All of this is *proved* here except `competing_sync_false` (the one operational stub) and
the realizability/preciseness input (`exists_reversing_trace` / `happensBefore_precise`,
which `reverse_barrier_contradiction` consumes). Pillar A (`mem_transClosure_of_transGen`),
the bridge, the arrive case, and the failing-pair extraction are complete. -/


/-- **Competing-sync reversal** — the `sync` sub-case of completeness, in the situation
where `c2` *is* forced after `c1` (`happensBefore c1 c2`). Two `sync`s, `c1` (generation
`k`) and `c2` (generation `k+1`), on the same barrier `b`, with `c2`'s in-thread
predecessor `c3` *not* ordered after `c1` (`¬ happensBefore c1 c3`).

Argument (per §5.2.7, the named-barrier case): run the ideal `G = {η | ¬ happensBefore c1 η}`
to its cut configuration. There `c1` heads its thread (`c1 ∈ F`) and `c2` heads its thread
(`c3 ∈ G` is `c2`'s predecessor, `c2 ∈ F`) — two threads both poised to `sync b`. Step
`c2` *instead of* `c1`: `c2` registers in `b`'s current round (so generation `≤ k`), or, if
that over-fills / mismatches the barrier, steps to `err`. Completing the trace gives a
complete trace in which `c2` does **not** have generation `k+1` — contradicting `hws`
(which fixes every `sync`'s generation across all complete traces).

This uses the *direct* run-`G`-then-step-`c2` construction; it does **not** factor through
the matching-arrive idea (false: `sync_configure` registers a thread directly, with no prior
`arrive`). It is built on the (sorried) `run_ideal` cut and `hws`-driven generation transfer. -/

/-- **Competing arrive/sync reversal** — the operational analog of `competing_sync_false`
for an `arrive` *source*. The flagged source `c1` is an `arrive b` of generation `k`; `c2`
is a `sync b` of generation `k+1` whose in-thread predecessor `c3` is *not* ordered after
`c1` (`¬ happensBefore c1 c3`), yet `c2` *is* forced after `c1` (`happensBefore c1 c2`).

This is the new obligation introduced by extending Step 3's generation check to `arrive`
sources (not just `sync`s). The intended argument mirrors `competing_sync_false`: run the
ideal `G = {η | ¬ happensBefore c1 η}` to its cut, where `c1` heads its thread poised to
`arrive b` and `c2` heads its thread poised to `sync b`; step `c2` into `b`'s still-open
round (generation `≤ k`, or `err` on over-fill), contradicting `hws`. Unlike the `sync`
case, the source `c1` parks in `b.arrived` (not `b.synced`) when it executes, so the
firing-configuration witness (`synced_before_recycle` in `competing_sync_false`) must be
re-derived from the `arrived` list. Stated here as the single isolated operational stub for
the `arrive`-source path; it rests on the same `run_ideal` cut as `competing_sync_false`. -/

/-- **Completeness, the predecessor-less (`c2.idx = 0`) case.** A barrier operation `c2`
that is the *first instruction of its thread* (`c2.idx = 0`) yet is assigned generation
`≥ 2` by the witness trace `τ` — here `pointGen T τ c2 = pointGen T τ c1 + 1` for a barrier
op `c1`, whose generation is `≥ 1` on the `done`-reaching `τ` — cannot belong to a
well-synchronized CTA: `c2` has no in-thread predecessor to anchor it after generation `k`,
so a schedule that steps `c2`'s thread first registers `c2` into an *earlier* generation
(generation `1`), making `c2`'s generation schedule-dependent. This is the formal version of
the 4-thread counterexample (`arrive 0 2 ‖ arrive 0 2 ‖ sync 0 2 ‖ sync 0 2`) that motivates
the `c2.idx = 0 ⇒ reject` clause of Step 3 in `CheckWellSynchronized`.

with a successful trace `τ`, the checker accepts iff `T` is well-synchronized. This
aggregates soundness (`wellSynchronized_of_check`, the `check = true → WS` direction) and
completeness (`not_wellSynchronized_of_check_false`, the `check = false → ¬WS` direction).

/-- *(Stated, not yet proved.)* **Local confluence with generation agreement for a
well-synchronized continuation.** From a configuration `(S, T)`, suppose:

* `σ₁` is a step `(S, T) → C'` (`hσ₁`), the continuation `C'` is well-synchronized
  (`hWS`) and has a successful trace `τ` (`hτ`);
* a second first step `σ₂`, namely `(S, T) → C''` (`hσ₂`) — *not* required to differ
  from `σ₁` (so `C''` may equal `C'`).

Then the two divergences reconverge — there are CTA-step *paths* `C' ⤳* Cd` and
`C'' ⤳* Cd` into a common configuration `Cd`, given as config lists `C' :: p'` and
`C'' :: p''` (each an `IsSubtrace` ending at `Cd`) — and the recovered generations agree:
for every complete trace `τ'` from `Cd` and every barrier instruction `η` of `(S, T)`, the
two reconverged traces — route through `C'` then follow `τ'`, vs. route through `C''` then
follow `τ'` — assign `η` a *common, nonzero* generation. The `(C' :: p').dropLast ++ τ'`
splice drops the shared `Cd` (contributed by `τ'`) so the glued list is a genuine trace.
The conclusion is phrased with `IsGenOf` in the shape of the `Config.WellSynchronized` body
(`∃ g, g ≠ 0 ∧ IsGenOf … ∧ IsGenOf …`), so it is a drop-in when discharging
well-synchronization of `(S, T)`.

Multi-step legs (vs. a one-step `σ₃ : C' → Cd`) are forced: when `σ₁` *completes* a barrier
(e.g. `arrive b n` with `n = 1`, or any `arrive`/`sync` that fills its barrier), the
post-`σ₁` state has a full barrier, so the `interleave` guard blocks every replay of `σ₂`
and no single-step `Cd` exists; the join then routes through a `recycle` leg. A single step
is the special case `p' = [Cd]` (then `(C' :: p').dropLast ++ τ' = C' :: τ'`), and `p' = []`
the degenerate `C' = Cd` leg.

(`σ₂` need not differ from `σ₁`: if `C'' = C'` the two reconverged traces coincide and the
claim is immediate. A natural witness for the common generation `g` is `pointGen T … η`,
related to `IsGenOf` by `isGenOf_pointGen`.)

Rohan notes: This is a (multi-step) diamond / local-confluence property that may be useful
for proving the soundness of the well-sync algorithm.
