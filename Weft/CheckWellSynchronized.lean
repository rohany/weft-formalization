# The well-synchronization check (§4.2, Figure 4)

`CheckWellSynchronized` is the executable algorithm of Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`) of the
Weft paper: given a CTA `T` and *one* concrete complete trace `τ` that runs
`(I, T)` to `done` (Figure 4's `assume τ ≡ (I, T), …, (F, done)`), it returns a
`Bool` that is `true` iff `T` is well-synchronized (Definition 6), together with the
computed happens-before relation (the transitive closure of Figure 4 line 17).

The idea (paper §4.2) is to read the generation map `Gen(τ)` off the *single*
concrete trace, build a static happens-before relation `R` that *every* schedule
must respect, take its transitive closure, and then check that `R` already forces
each later-generation barrier operation to wait for the matching earlier-generation
`sync`. If it does, no alternative schedule could pair the synchronizations up
differently, so all traces share `Gen(τ)` and `T` is well-synchronized.

This is the *checking* side of the development; the `*.WellSynchronized` predicates
of `Weft.WellSynchronized` are the *specification* (Definitions 6–7). We implement
the algorithm faithfully but do not yet prove the paper's soundness/completeness
(Definitions 9–10) linking the two.

## Computable `Gen(τ)` (`pointGen`)

`Gen(τ)` is Definition 5's relation `IsGenOf` turned into a function on program
points. Its two ingredients, time and recycle-counting, are already computable:
`recycleCount` counts recyclings directly from the trace, and the time `t(τ, η)` is
found by `pointTime`. We locate the executing step of `η = ⟨i, k⟩` by program
*length*: thread `i`'s remaining program shrinks only by dropping prefixes (it is
always a suffix of `T.prog i`, by `CTAStep.progOf_suffix`), so a suffix is pinned
down by its length. Instruction `k` executes at the step where thread `i`'s
remaining length falls from `|T.prog i| − k` to `|T.prog i| − k − 1` — for a `sync`
this is the recycle step, exactly as in Definition 3. This matches `IsTimeOf` /
`IsGenOf` on a genuine trace from `(I, T)` (the 1-indexed `+ 1` convention, with `0`
for a command that never executes — see the `IsGenOf` doc).

is well-synchronized (Definition 6), and `hb` is the computed happens-before
relation — the transitive closure (Figure 4 line 17) of the static edges built from
`Gen(τ)`. (The relation is returned regardless of `ok`, e.g. for downstream
race-freedom analysis, Definition 8.)

`τ` is a concrete complete trace from `(I, T)` ending in `done` (the algorithm's
standing assumption — e.g. from `CTA.WellSynchronized.exists_successfulTrace`, or a
concrete simulation; a `τ` that deadlocks or errors already witnesses a violation
and need not be checked).

`c1` of generation `k` on barrier `b`, and every barrier-`b` operation `c2` of
generation `k+1` whose in-thread predecessor is `c3`, `hb` must already order `c1`
before `c3` (`(c1, c3) ∈ hb`). If some such ordering is missing, a different
schedule could pair the synchronizations up differently, so `ok = false`. -/

/-! ## Lemma 1 — the happens-before relation is sound and precise (Definition 4)

Weft's **Lemma 1**: *for well-synchronized configurations the static happens-before
relation as constructed in Figure 4 is sound and precise* (Definition 4,
`Weft.SoundAndPrecise`). That relation is the second component returned by the
algorithm, `(CheckWellSynchronized T τ).2`. Definition 4 is an *iff* between an edge
of `R` and a schedule-independent timing fact; its two directions are the soundness
and preciseness sublemmas below, which assemble into the full lemma. `happensBefore_sound`
is *proved* below by reducing (via `mem_transClosure_imp_transGen` and `Relation.TransGen`
induction) to two per-edge facts, `initRelation_edge_sound` and `initRelation_src_timed`,
which carry the remaining semantic content as stubs; `happensBefore_precise` is still a
full stub. -/

/-- The computable `pointGen` *is* the generation: for a barrier command `a` that
executes in `τ`, `IsGenOf (I, T) τ a (pointGen T τ a)` holds (`pointTime` computes the
time, so `pointGen` computes `recycleCount …`). -/

/-- Per-edge soundness (the core semantic content). Each edge of `initRelation T τ`
is a genuine ordering in every complete trace from `(I, T)`:

* **program-order** edges `⟨i,k⟩ → ⟨i,k+1⟩` — sound because there is no out-of-order
  execution within a thread (`progOrder_time_le`);
* **`arrive b n → sync b n`** and **`sync ↔ sync`** edges of equal generation — sound
  because well-synchronization fixes barrier generations across all traces, so the
  target `sync`'s recycle step both pins the generation and orders it after `a`. -/

/-! ## Theorem 1 — soundness of `CheckWellSynchronized`

The paper's **Theorem 1**: a successful run of the check witnesses
well-synchronization. The paper proves it by induction on the suffixes of the
`done`-reaching execution — *not* via Lemma 1, which would be circular (only
well-synchronized configurations are known to have a sound `R`, yet here `R` is what
we use to conclude well-synchronization). Stated here as a stub. -/

/-- **Theorem 1.** If `τ` is a complete trace from `(I, T)` ending in `done`
(`τ ≡ (I, T) ⤳* (F, done)`) and `CheckWellSynchronized T τ` returns `true`, then `T`
is well-synchronized. -/
