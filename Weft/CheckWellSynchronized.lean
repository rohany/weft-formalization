# The well-synchronization check (§4.2, Figure 4)

`CheckWellSynchronized` is the executable algorithm of Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`) of the
Weft paper: given a CTA `T` and *one* concrete complete trace `τ` that runs
`(I, T)` to `done` (Figure 4's `assume τ ≡ (I, T), …, (F, done)`), it returns a
`Bool` that is `true` iff `T` is well-synchronized (Definition 6), together with the
computed happens-before relation (the transitive closure of Figure 4 line 17).

The idea (paper §4.2) is to read the generation map `Gen(τ)` off the *single*
concrete trace, build a static happens-before relation `R` that *every* schedule
must respect, take its transitive closure, and then check that `R` already forces
each later-generation barrier operation to wait for the matching earlier-generation
`sync`. If it does, no alternative schedule could pair the synchronizations up
differently, so all traces share `Gen(τ)` and `T` is well-synchronized.

This is the *checking* side of the development; the `*.WellSynchronized` predicates
of `Weft.WellSynchronized` are the *specification* (Definitions 6–7). We implement
the algorithm faithfully but do not yet prove the paper's soundness/completeness
(Definitions 9–10) linking the two.

## Computable `Gen(τ)` (`pointGen`)

`Gen(τ)` is Definition 5's relation `IsGenOf` turned into a function on program
points. Its two ingredients, time and recycle-counting, are already computable:
`recycleCount` counts recyclings directly from the trace, and the time `t(τ, η)` is
found by `pointTime`. We locate the executing step of `η = ⟨i, k⟩` by program
*length*: thread `i`'s remaining program shrinks only by dropping prefixes (it is
always a suffix of `T.prog i`, by `CTAStep.progOf_suffix`), so a suffix is pinned
down by its length. Instruction `k` executes at the step where thread `i`'s
remaining length falls from `|T.prog i| − k` to `|T.prog i| − k − 1` — for a `sync`
this is the recycle step, exactly as in Definition 3. This matches `IsTimeOf` /
`IsGenOf` on a genuine trace from `(I, T)` (the 1-indexed `+ 1` convention, with `0`
for a command that never executes — see the `IsGenOf` doc).

/-- The transitive closure of a relation given as a finite set of edges `R`:
repeatedly add a composed edge `(e.1, f.2)` whenever `e ∈ S` and `f ∈ R` meet at

most `|R|` edges. -/

-- TODO(proof): prove `transClosure` correct, i.e.
--   `(a, b) ∈ transClosure R ↔ Relation.TransGen (fun x y => (x, y) ∈ R) a b`.
-- This includes justifying the `R.card`-rounds saturation bound (a simple path uses
-- at most `|R|` edges, so the fixpoint is reached within `R.card` rounds). The
-- `Relation.TransGen` direction gives access to its induction API for the eventual
-- soundness proof of `CheckWellSynchronized`.

/-- **Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`).** Returns `(ok, hb)` where `ok = true` iff the CTA `T`
is well-synchronized (Definition 6), and `hb` is the computed happens-before
relation — the transitive closure (Figure 4 line 17) of the static edges built from
`Gen(τ)`. (The relation is returned regardless of `ok`, e.g. for downstream
race-freedom analysis, Definition 8.)

`τ` is a concrete complete trace from `(I, T)` ending in `done` (the algorithm's
standing assumption — e.g. from `CTA.WellSynchronized.exists_successfulTrace`, or a
concrete simulation; a `τ` that deadlocks or errors already witnesses a violation
and need not be checked).

A direct transcription of Figure 4. Step 3 (lines 18–22) checks: for every `sync`
`c1` of generation `k` on barrier `b`, and every barrier-`b` operation `c2` of
generation `k+1` whose in-thread predecessor is `c3`, `hb` must already order `c1`
before `c3` (`(c1, c3) ∈ hb`). If some such ordering is missing, a different
schedule could pair the synchronizations up differently, so `ok = false`. -/

/-! ## Lemma 1 — the happens-before relation is sound and precise (Definition 4)

Weft's **Lemma 1**: *for well-synchronized configurations the static happens-before
relation as constructed in Figure 4 is sound and precise* (Definition 4,
`Weft.SoundAndPrecise`). That relation is the second component returned by the
algorithm, `(CheckWellSynchronized T τ).2`. Definition 4 is an *iff* between an edge
of `R` and a schedule-independent timing fact; its two directions are the soundness
and preciseness sublemmas below, which assemble into the full lemma. All three are
stubs (proofs are future work, resting on the `transClosure` correctness `TODO`). -/

/-- Soundness half of Lemma 1: every edge `(η₁, η₂)` of the computed happens-before
relation is a *genuine* ordering — in every complete trace from `(I, T)`, `η₁`
executes no later than `η₂`. (Per the paper: direct, because there is no
out-of-order execution within a thread and well-synchronization fixes barrier
generations across all traces.) This is the `→` direction of `SoundAndPrecise`. -/

/-- Preciseness half of Lemma 1: the computed happens-before relation captures
*every* genuine ordering — if `η₁` executes no later than `η₂` in every complete
trace from `(I, T)`, then `(η₁, η₂)` is an edge of `R`. (Per the paper: by induction
on program size, since the tuples in `R` are the only ordering restrictions the
semantics imposes.) This is the `←` direction of `SoundAndPrecise`. -/
