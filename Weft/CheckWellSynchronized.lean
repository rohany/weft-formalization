# The well-synchronization check (§4.2, Figure 4)

`CheckWellSynchronized` is the executable algorithm of Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`) of the
Weft paper: given a CTA `T` and *one* concrete complete trace `τ` that runs
`(I, T)` to `done` (Figure 4's `assume τ ≡ (I, T), …, (F, done)`), it returns a
`Bool` that is `true` iff `T` is well-synchronized (Definition 6), together with the
computed happens-before relation (the transitive closure of Figure 4 line 17).

The idea (paper §4.2) is to read the generation map `Gen(τ)` off the *single*
concrete trace, build a static happens-before relation `R` that *every* schedule
must respect, take its transitive closure, and then check that `R` already forces
each later-generation barrier operation to wait for the matching earlier-generation
`sync`. If it does, no alternative schedule could pair the synchronizations up
differently, so all traces share `Gen(τ)` and `T` is well-synchronized.

This is the *checking* side of the development; the `*.WellSynchronized` predicates
of `Weft.WellSynchronized` are the *specification* (Definitions 6–7). We implement
the algorithm faithfully but do not yet prove the paper's soundness/completeness
(Definitions 9–10) linking the two.

## Computable `Gen(τ)` (`pointGen`)

`Gen(τ)` is Definition 5's relation `IsGenOf` turned into a function on program
points. Its two ingredients, time and recycle-counting, are already computable:
`recycleCount` counts recyclings directly from the trace, and the time `t(τ, η)` is
found by `pointTime`. We locate the executing step of `η = ⟨i, k⟩` by program
*length*: thread `i`'s remaining program shrinks only by dropping prefixes (it is
always a suffix of `T.prog i`, by `CTAStep.progOf_suffix`), so a suffix is pinned
down by its length. Instruction `k` executes at the step where thread `i`'s
remaining length falls from `|T.prog i| − k` to `|T.prog i| − k − 1` — for a `sync`
this is the recycle step, exactly as in Definition 3. This matches `IsTimeOf` /
`IsGenOf` on a genuine trace from `(I, T)` (the 1-indexed `+ 1` convention, with `0`
for a command that never executes — see the `IsGenOf` doc).

/-- **Figure 4 (`WELLSYNC`).** Returns `(ok, hb)` where `ok = true` iff the CTA `T`
is well-synchronized (Definition 6), and `hb` is the computed happens-before
relation — the transitive closure (Figure 4 line 17) of the static edges built from
`Gen(τ)`. (The relation is returned regardless of `ok`, e.g. for downstream
race-freedom analysis, Definition 8.)

`τ` is a concrete complete trace from `(I, T)` ending in `done` (the algorithm's
standing assumption — e.g. from `CTA.WellSynchronized.exists_successfulTrace`, or a
concrete simulation; a `τ` that deadlocks or errors already witnesses a violation
and need not be checked).

`c1` of generation `k` on barrier `b`, and every barrier-`b` operation `c2` of
generation `k+1` whose in-thread predecessor is `c3`, `hb` must already order `c1`
before `c3` (`(c1, c3) ∈ hb`). If some such ordering is missing, a different
schedule could pair the synchronizations up differently, so `ok = false`. -/

/-! ## Lemma 1 — the happens-before relation is sound and precise (Definition 4)

Weft's **Lemma 1**: *for well-synchronized configurations the static happens-before
relation as constructed in Figure 4 is sound and precise* (Definition 4,
`Weft.SoundAndPrecise`). That relation is the second component returned by the
algorithm, `(CheckWellSynchronized T τ).2`. Definition 4 is an *iff* between an edge
of `R` and a schedule-independent timing fact; its two directions are the soundness
and preciseness sublemmas below, which assemble into the full lemma. `happensBefore_sound`
is *proved* below by reducing (via `mem_transClosure_imp_transGen` and `Relation.TransGen`
induction) to two per-edge facts, `initRelation_edge_sound` and `initRelation_src_timed`,
which carry the remaining semantic content as stubs; `happensBefore_precise` is still a
full stub. -/

/-- The computable `pointGen` *is* the generation: for a barrier command `a` that
executes in `τ`, `IsGenOf (I, T) τ a (pointGen T τ a)` holds (`pointTime` computes the
time, so `pointGen` computes `recycleCount …`). -/

is a genuine ordering in every complete trace from `(I, T)`:

* **program-order** edges `⟨i,k⟩ → ⟨i,k+1⟩` — sound because there is no out-of-order
  execution within a thread (`progOrder_time_le`);
* **`arrive b n → sync b n`** and **`sync ↔ sync`** edges of equal generation — sound
  because well-synchronization fixes barrier generations across all traces, so the
  target `sync`'s recycle step both pins the generation and orders it after `a`. -/

/-- **Realizability / reversing-schedule lemma** — the heart of preciseness (the
genuine cross-thread content). If `η₁` is *not* happens-before `η₂`, then some
complete trace from `(I, T)` runs `η₂` strictly before `η₁`.

Construction (strategy C/D, by induction on program size `CTA.numCmds`): the set
`G = {η | ¬ happensBefore T τ η₁ η}` is *down-closed* under `initRelation` edges — it
is a per-thread program **prefix** (program order), and it contains whole barrier
rounds (same-generation `sync`s are mutually related, so a round is wholly in or
wholly out of `G`). Run `G` to completion first — reaching a clean configuration with
exactly the complement `F` remaining — then finish with `exists_completeTrace`. Since
`η₂ ∈ G` (`¬ happensBefore η₁ η₂`, reflexively `η₂ ≠ η₁`) and `η₁ ∉ G` (`happensBefore`
is reflexive), `η₂` executes in the `G`-prefix and `η₁` in the `F`-suffix, so
`t(η₂) < t(η₁)`.

This is the one remaining `sorry`; the contrapositive wrapper (`happensBefore_precise`,
different-threads case) is complete. -/

/-- Preciseness half of Lemma 1: the happens-before relation captures *every* genuine
ordering — if `η₁` executes no later than `η₂` in every complete trace from `(I, T)`,
then `happensBefore T τ η₁ η₂` holds. (Per the paper: by induction on program size,
since the tuples in `R` are the only ordering restrictions the semantics imposes.)
This is the `←` direction of `SoundAndPrecise`.

The `η₁, η₂ ∈ T.progPoints` hypotheses are **necessary**: a non-executing point has no
`IsTimeOf`, so `hle` would hold vacuously while `happensBefore` (whose edges only touch
program points, `initRelation_cases`) cannot relate it — the same vacuous-timing defect
that forced reflexivity, now for invalid indices.

Cases on the two points:
* `η₁ = η₂` — `Relation.ReflTransGen.refl`.
* same thread, `η₁ ≠ η₂` — `hle` forces `η₁.idx < η₂.idx` (`time_lt_of_idx_lt`), and the
  program-order edges chain `η₁` to `η₂` (`progOrder_happensBefore`). **Proved.**
* different threads — the genuine content: an inter-thread ordering must run through a
  barrier, and one must exhibit the `Relation.TransGen` chain witnessing it (the paper's
  argument that the `initRelation` tuples are the *only* restrictions the semantics
  imposes). This is the one remaining `sorry`. -/

/-- **Lemma 1.** For a well-synchronized configuration `(I, T)`, the static
happens-before relation constructed in Figure 4 — `happensBefore T τ`, the
reflexive-transitive closure of `initRelation T τ` — is sound and precise in the
sense of Definition 4 (`Weft.SoundAndPrecise`), **on program points**.

The valid-point restriction (`η₁ η₂ ∈ T.progPoints`) is required: the unrestricted
`SoundAndPrecise` is false, because for a never-executing point the timing side is
vacuously true while `happensBefore` cannot relate it (see `happensBefore_precise`).

The paper's **Theorem 1**: a successful run of the check witnesses
well-synchronization. The paper proves it by induction on the suffixes of the
`done`-reaching execution — *not* via Lemma 1, which would be circular (only
well-synchronized configurations are known to have a sound `R`, yet here `R` is what
we use to conclude well-synchronization). Stated here as a stub. -/

/-- **Theorem 1.** If `τ` is a complete trace from `(I, T)` ending in `done`
(`τ ≡ (I, T) ⤳* (F, done)`) and `CheckWellSynchronized T τ` returns `true`, then `T`
is well-synchronized. -/
