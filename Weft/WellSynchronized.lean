# Generations and well-synchronization (§4.1)

This file continues Section 4.1 of the Weft paper with Definition 5 (generations),
Definition 6 (well-synchronized CTA), and Definition 7 (well-synchronized
configuration). They build on the traces and time of `Weft.Traces`.

## Definition 5 — generations

`Gen(τ)(cη)` tags a synchronization command `cη` (on some barrier `b`) with *which
generation* of `b` it used; unexecuted commands have generation `0`.

The paper's verbatim Def 5 reads `Gen(τ)(cη) = n` where `t(τ, η) = m` and the
first `m` steps of `τ` contain `n` recyclings of `b`. Taken literally this is
inconsistent: by Def 3 (`Weft.Traces`) `t` is the *registration* step for an
`arrive` but the *recycle* step for a `sync`, so a `sync` counts the recycle that
closes its round while a co-registering `arrive` does not. They would then get
different generations, and a first-generation `arrive` would get `0` — conflicting
both with "executed ⟹ nonzero" and with the `≠ 0` of Definitions 6–7.

We therefore use the consistent, evidently-intended **1-indexed** reading:
`Gen(τ)(cη) = (recyclings of b strictly before t(τ, η)) + 1`. For a `sync` this
equals the verbatim count (the closing recycle sits exactly at `t`, so "strictly
before, then `+1`" = "up to and including"); for an `arrive` it is the verbatim
count `+ 1`. Under it, an `arrive` and a `sync` that synchronize on the same round
get the *same* generation, and every executed synchronization command has
generation `≥ 1`.

To count recyclings of `b` from a trace (a `List Config`, which records configs
but not the rule that fired), we use that **only `CTAStep.recycle` ever resets a
barrier to unconfigured** — every thread step on `b` configures it or extends its
lists, never unconfigures it. So a step `C ⤳ C'` recycles `b` exactly when `b` is
configured-and-full in `C` and unconfigured in `C'` (`stepRecyclesBarrier`).

We model `Gen(τ)(cη) = n` as the relation `IsGenOf C₀ τ η n`. It is total on
synchronization commands: an executed sync command gets generation `≥ 1`, and one
that never executes in `τ` (e.g. blocked by a deadlock) gets `0` — the paper's
convention that unexecuted commands have generation `0`. On the memory commands
`read`/`write` it is undefined (they are not in `Gen`'s domain).

## Definitions 6 and 7 — well-synchronization

A configuration `(s, T)` is *well-synchronized* (Def 7) if any two complete traces
from it agree on the generation of every synchronization command, and that common
generation is nonzero — i.e. every sync command executes, at a schedule-independent
generation. A CTA `T` is well-synchronized (Def 6) when the configuration
`(I, T)` is, where `I` is the initial state — the special case of Def 7 at
`State.initial`.

namespace Weft

/-- The barrier a command operates on: `some b` for the synchronization commands
`sync b _` and `arrive b _`, and `none` for the memory operations. -/
def Cmd.barrier? : Cmd → Option Barrier
  | .sync b _ => some b
  | .arrive b _ => some b
  | .read _ => none
  | .write _ => none

/-- The state component `(E, B)` of a configuration, if it has one. `run` and
`done` carry a state; the error configuration `err` does not. -/
def Config.state? : Config → Option State
  | .run s _ => some s
  | .done s => some s
  | .err _ => none

/-- A barrier state is *full* when it is configured (count `some n`) and exactly
`n` threads have registered (`|I| + |A| = n`) — the situation in which
`CTAStep.recycle` fires. -/
def BarrierState.isFull (β : BarrierState) : Bool :=
  match β.count with
  | some n => β.synced.length + β.arrived.length == n
  | none => false

/-- The step `C ⤳ C'` recycles barrier `b`: `b` is configured-and-full in `C` and
reset to unconfigured in `C'`. Since only `CTAStep.recycle` resets a barrier, this
detects exactly the recycle steps for `b` along a trace. -/
def stepRecyclesBarrier (b : Barrier) (C C' : Config) : Bool :=
  match C.state?, C'.state? with
  | some s, some s' => (s.B b).isFull && decide (s'.B b = BarrierState.unconfigured)
  | _, _ => false

/-- The number of recyclings of barrier `b` among the first `m` steps of `τ`
(the transitions from config index `j` to `j+1` for `j < m`). -/
def recycleCount (b : Barrier) (τ : List Config) (m : Nat) : Nat :=
  (List.range m).countP fun j =>
    match τ[j]?, τ[j + 1]? with
    | some C, some C' => stepRecyclesBarrier b C C'
    | _, _ => false

/-- Definition 5 (§4.1), in the consistent 1-indexed reading (see the module
doc). The generation `Gen(τ)(cη) = n` of a synchronization command at program
point `η`, in a complete trace `τ` from `C₀`. If `cη` operates on barrier `b` and
executes at time `t(τ, η) = m`, then `n` is one more than the number of recyclings
of `b` strictly before step `m` (`recycleCount b τ (m - 1)` counts the recyclings
in the first `m - 1` steps); if `cη` is a synchronization command that never
executes in `τ` (e.g. blocked by a deadlock), then `n = 0`. Like `IsTimeOf`, it
carries `IsCompleteTraceFrom C₀ τ` so it is meaningful used on its own. As a
function of `(C₀, τ, η)` it is total on synchronization commands (`≥ 1` when
executed, `0` when not) and undefined on the memory commands `read`/`write` (not
in `Gen`'s domain).

Note (rohany): The (m-1) + 1 thing is a bit odd, but it has to deal with some
ambiguity in the Weft paper. Definition 5 in the weft paper should should be that
there are n recyclings strictly before m. However, the time definition is inclusive
of the instruction that executes at m. So the m-1 is needed to get to "strictly-before".
And then the plus 1 is because we want barrier generations to be 1-indexed rather than
0-indexed, because the formalization uses a 0 generation for an operation to represent
when the operation has not executed at all in the trace (i.e. deadlocks).

/-- Definition 7 (§4.1). A configuration `C₀ = (s, T)` is *well-synchronized* if
any two complete traces from it assign every synchronization command the same,
nonzero generation: for all complete traces `τ₁ τ₂` from `C₀` and every program
point `η` that is a synchronization command, there is a common `g ≠ 0` with
`Gen(τ₁)(cη) = Gen(τ₂)(cη) = g`. -/
